# Devour - project-1

## Product Vision
FOR groups of friends or Office teams WHO want to plan a lunch event.(THE)
Devour is a social food browsing and recommendation service THAT provides
users a way to organize dinner plans with friends, colleagues, even family members taking everyone’s preferences in mind. UNLIKE Yelp, rather than being a
search tool, we offer suggestions to the customer, tailored to their preferred cuisine while also helping restaurants promote their business. UNLIKE seamless,
ubereats, grubhub, we do not focus on delivering the food to the customer and
we also don’t charge commissions to restaurants directly . This is attractive to
restaurants because the commission they pay to these delivery services is often
too high. Instead we will focus on charging a commision service from the delivery services directly where they in return will get more exposure to potential
new customers. OUR PRODUCT provides a social twist and exciting twist
on dining with friends.
